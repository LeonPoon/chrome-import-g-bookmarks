Synchronise your bookmarks from Google Bookmarks into Chrome.

To use: 

1. Create a folder named "Google Bookmarks" under "Bookmarks Bar" (use Bookmark Manager.) 
2. Sign in to your Google account at any Google website. 
3. Wait a couple minutes or restart your Chrome.

**If it doesn't seem to work, please visiting <http://www.google.com/bookmarks/?output=xml&num=10000> to see if the plugin is able to access your bookmarks properly. The plugin accesses this page.**

Labels on bookmarks are treated as path names in which the bookmark appear, using the colon character (":") as folder separator. For example: the label "Development:Android" will cause this path to be made in your bookmarks: "Bookmarks Bar/Google Bookmarks/Development/Android". Unlabeled bookmarks appear in the root "Google Bookmarks" folder.

Changes made to Google Bookmarks will be synchronised into Chrome every one minute.
